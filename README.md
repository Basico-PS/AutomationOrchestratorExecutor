# Basico P/S - Automation Orchestrator Executor

<i>Still under initial development, better documentation is underway...</i>

For support, please contact us: robotics@basico.dk

This solution is an add-on to the [Basico P/S - Automation Orchestrator](https://github.com/Basico-PS/AutomationOrchestrator) allowing you to monitor the execution queue from a different machine in your protected internal network and execute the pending scripts assigned to your machine and user.

## Installation

For the solution to work, you need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/). The solution is tested with Python 3.7 and 3.8.

1. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/Basico-PS/AutomationOrchestratorExecutor/archive/v0.0.3.zip).
2. Create a folder called "Automation Orchestrator Executor" somewhere convenient, for example, directly on the C: drive or in the "Program Files" folder.
3. Unzip the folder in your created "Automation Orchestrator Executor" folder. So, your path could be similar to "C:\Automation Orchestrator Executor\AutomationOrchestratorExecutor-0.0.3" or "C:\Program Files\Automation Orchestrator\AutomationOrchestratorExecutor-0.0.3". However, you may unzip the folder anywhere on your system.
4. After unzipping the folder, run the "INSTALL.bat" [file](https://github.com/Basico-PS/AutomationOrchestratorExecutor/blob/master/INSTALL.bat) for an automated installation process. You may also manually run the installation steps via, for example, the CMD. Remember to run the batch file (or commands manually) as an administrator.

## Usage

After a succesful installation, and as long as the Automation Orchestrator server is running in your protected internal network, you can now start your executor using the "RUN_SERVER.bat" [file](https://github.com/Basico-PS/AutomationOrchestratorExecutor/blob/master/RUN_EXECUTOR.bat). Remember to run the batch file (or commands manually) as an administrator.
